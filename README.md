MathSockets
===========

A Node.js script which launches a WebSocket server pushing a given Markdown-file to the browser and re-rendering on update.

Mathematical formulas are supported and typeset using the MathJax library.

The Markdown-parser is based on Showdown by John Fraser. It has been slightly modified to appropriately handle inline- and display math blocks.
